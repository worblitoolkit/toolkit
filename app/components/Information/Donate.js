      <h5>Dear WorbliToolkit supporters,</h5>
      <p>
        The <strong>WorbliToolkit</strong> was made out of love prior to the launch of the WBI mainnet thanks to long hours
        late into the night and a staunch belief in making WBI accessible to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to your support and votes <strong>Team GenerEOS</strong> now receives block rewards and this helps fund
        further development of the eostoolkit and other WBI projects.
      </p>
      <p>However, the goal of GenerEOS is to give back to the community.</p>
      <p>
        By donating you will be supporting development of the <strong>WorbliToolkit</strong> directly, while allowing
        GenerEOS to give even more back to those who need it most.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope you love the <strong>WorbliToolkit</strong> as much as I{"'"}ve loved making it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>&hearts;,</strong>
        <br />
        Nathan Rempel, Team GenerEOS
      </p>
